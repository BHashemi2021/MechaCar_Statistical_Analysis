## Background
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, we will help Jeremy and the data analytics team by performing the following tasks:
  •	Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
  •	Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
  •	Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
  •	Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

#### What We Are Creating
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. 
  •	Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  •	Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
  •	Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
  •	Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

Deliverable 1 
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
In this analysis we used MechaCar_mpg.csv file containing data with six variables as shown in Figure 1.

------------------------------

•	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
•	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
•	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

•	The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)
•	An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables (10 pt)
•	An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values (10 pt)
•	There is a summary that addresses all three questions (5 pt)



Deliverable 2
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils 
write a short summary detailing and interpreting the suspension coil summary statistics.
using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, 
address the following question:
•	The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

•	The Suspension_Coil.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)
•	An RScript is written to create a total summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the PSI for all manufacturing lots (10 pt)
•	An RScript is written to create a lot summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each manufacturing lot (10 pt)
•	There is a summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually (5 pt)



Deliverable 3
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
In your README, create a subheading ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils, then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
•	An RScript is written for t-test that compares all manufacturing lots against mean PSI of the population (5 pt)
•	An RScript is written for three t-tests that compare each manufacturing lot against mean PSI of the population (10 pt)
•	There is a summary of the t-test results across all manufacturing lots and for each lot (5 pt)



Deliverable 4
After you’ve completed the technical analysis for each deliverable, provide a short summary of the results in the README.md of the analysis. For the final deliverable, you’ll write up a short description of the study design for additional statistical analysis. In the written summaries, we would like you to think critically about your analysis, not demonstrate mastery of automotive manufacturing.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
1.	Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
2.	In your description, address the following questions:
•	What metric or metrics are you going to test?
•	What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
•	What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
•	What data is needed to run the statistical test?

•	A metric to be tested is mentioned (5 pt)
•	A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described (5 pt)
•	A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis (5 pt)
•	The data for the statistical test is described (5 pt)
